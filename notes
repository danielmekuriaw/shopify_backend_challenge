Re-write the takeANumber function (JavaScript) 
so that instead of working with customer names our deli issues ticket numbers. At the beginning of the day, when the line is empty and a customer walks in and they take a number by calling takeANumber, the program should:

add the customer to the line
say “Welcome. You are ticket number 1”
The next customer that walks in should be number “2”, and so on.

When the first customer’s order is ready, the program should: * remove the customer from the line * say “Currently serving 1”
